Low coverage local ancestry estimation

This software package provides the source code and executables used to estimate local ancestry from low-coverage whole-genome sequences. The basic approach follows the composite likelihood of J Wall et al. (2011; Molecular Biology and Evolution) but accounting for the uncertainty in genotype calls that arises due to having low-coverage data. Further details can be found in the README file in the tarball, as well as in J Wall et al. (2016; Molecular Ecology).
